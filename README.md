# Cyano-tools

## Tools to analyze fluorescence, microscopy and spectroscopy data, as obtained in wet-lab measurements for algae, cyanobacteria and eventually for plants 

### The tools, available online (https://tools-py.e-cyanobacterium.org/), are designed to process data for the following methods:
- Fluorometry
  - OJIP curves
  - Rapid light curves
- Microscopy
  - Cell counting
  - Cell size
  - Pixel profiles
- Spectrofluorometry
  - Ratio of PSII/PSI, antenna attachment to PSII or PSI

### The tools accept data files from the following devices:
- Fluorometers
  - Walz Multi-Color PAM / Dual PAM (.csv)
  - PSI AquaPen / FluorPen (.txt)
- Confocal and fluorescence microscopes: .png, .jpg, .jpeg, .tif, .tiff, .bmp, .gif
- Spectrofluorometers
  - Jasco FP series (https://jascoinc.com/products/spectroscopy/fluorometer/spectrofluorometer-models/) (.csv)
