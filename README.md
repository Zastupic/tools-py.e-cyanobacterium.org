# Cyano-tools

## Computational tools for the analysis of fluorescence, microscopic and spectroscopic data, as obtained in laboratories working with algae, cyanobacteria and plants

### The tools, available online (https://tools-py.e-cyanobacterium.org/), are designed to perform the following analyses:
- ***Fluorometry***
  - ***OJIP curves***
    - Shifting (to F<sub>0</sub>' and F<sub>P</sub>) and normalizing (between F<sub>0</sub>' and F<sub>P</sub>) the measured OJIP curves, uploaded by a user
    - Identifying F<sub>J</sub>, F<sub>I</sub> and F<sub>P</sub> timing based on a second derivation of the fluorescence signal
    - Eventual manual correction of F<sub>J</sub> and F<sub>I</sub> timing
    - Calculating relevant parameters, including those based on F<sub>J</sub> and F<sub>I</sub>
    - Plotting all OJIP curves (measured, shifted and normalized), second derivations and the calculated parameters
    - Exporting all results and plots to a summary **.xlsx** file, available for download
  - ***Rapid light curves***
