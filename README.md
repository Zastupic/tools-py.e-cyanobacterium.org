# Cyano-tools

## Tools for the analysis of fluorescence, microscopic and spectroscopic data obtained in wet-labs working with algae, cyanobacteria and plants

### The tools, available online (https://tools-py.e-cyanobacterium.org/), are designed to process the following data:
- ***Fluorometry***
  - ***OJIP curves***
    - Shifting (to F<sub>0</sub>' and F<sub>P</sub>) and normalizing (between F<sub>0</sub>' and F<sub>P</sub>) the measured curves
    - Iidentification of F<sub>J</sub>, F<sub>I</sub> and F<sub>P</sub> timing based on second derivation of the fluorescence signal
    - Eventual manual correction of F<sub>J</sub> and F<sub>I</sub> timing
    - Calculation of relevant parameters, including those based on F<sub>J</sub> and F<sub>I</sub>,
    - Plotting the measured, shifted and normalized OJIP curves, derivations and the calculated parameters
    - Exporting all results and plots to **.xlsx** file
  - ***Rapid light curves***
    - Plotting the measured curves
    - Fitting the measured curves by the equation of Platt et al., 1980
    - Calculation of relevant parameters
    - Exporting all results and plots to **.xlsx** file
- ***Microscopy***
  - ***Cell counting*** _(fluorescence microscopy, confocal microscopy)_
    - ***Round cells***
      - Automated identification of the cells on a fluorescence microscopy image
      - Automated counting of the cells
      - Eventual manual correction
      - Exporting all results and plots to **.xlsx** file
    - ***Filamentous strains***
      - Automated identification of filaments on a fluorescence microscopy image
      - Automated splitting the filaments to individual cells, and counting the individual cells
      - Eventual manual correction
      - Exporting all results and plots to **.xlsx** file
  - ***Cell size estimation*** _(confocal microscopy)_
    - ***Round cells***
      - Manual selection of the cells on a fluorescence microscopy image
      - Automated determination of size of the selected cells, including plotting
      - Exporting all results and plots to **.xlsx** file
    - ***Filamentous strains***
      - Manual selection of the cells on a microscopy image
      - Manual determination of size of the selected cells, including plotting
      - Exporting all results and plots to **.xlsx** file
  - ***Pixel profiles***
    - ***Round cells***
      - Manual selection of the cells on a fluorescence microscopy image
      - Automated determination of pixels intensity across the cell profile  (with fixed angle of 15Â°), including plotting
      - Exporting all results and plots to **.xlsx** file
    - ***Filamentous strains***
      - Manual selection of the cells and cells cross-section on a microscopy image

  - Selection of type of organism
    -  Strain with _chlorophyll_ only
    -  Strain with _chlorophyll_ and _phycocyanin_
    -  Strain with _chlorophyll_ and _phycoerythrin_
    -  Strain with _chlorophyll_ and _phycocyanin_ and _phycoerythrin_
  - Selection of excitation and emission wavelengths of interest within the measured fluorescence excitation-emission matrix
  - Selection of excitation and emission wavelengths for normalization
  - Calculation of parameters related to ratio of PSII/PSI, antenna attachment to PSII or PSI
  - Plotting the spectra and calculated parameters
  - Exporting all results and plots to **.xlsx** file

### The tools accept data files from the following devices:
- ***Fluorometers***
  - **Multi-Color PAM / Dual PAM**, Walz
    - .csv
  - **AquaPen / FluorPen**, Photon System Instruments
    - .txt
- ***Confocal and fluorescence microscopes***
  - .png, .jpg, .jpeg, .tif, .tiff, .bmp, .gif
- ***Spectrofluorometers***

### The tools are based on python ***Flask*** framework, and are hosted at https://www.pythonanywhere.com/. The files related to individual tools are located in the folder ***Website*** within main folder (***Flask_server***). The folder ***Website*** contains the following sub-folders and files:
- Folder **static**
  - Folder **images**
  - Folder **files**
  - Folder **uploads**
  - Files:
    - The main **.css** file
    - All **.js** files
- Folder **templates**
  - All **.html** files
- Files:
  - All **.py** files
